# CS4200-4InALinePlayer

Running the `board.py` file will start a 4-in-a-line game. You will be asked
to input whether or not you want to start, and the computer will respond
accordingly.

Lines 10-13 will control the constant variables of the algorithm.
If line 252 is changed to `b.lonely_loop()`, the computer will play against itself.
